<strong>Why Magnetic scales:</strong><br />
<ul>
  <li>Are immune to coolant and dust. They have full IP-67 rating ( scales suited for contaminated or dirty environmental conditions). <br /></li>
  <li>Are very durable than the glass type.</li>
  <li>Unlike glass scales can be cut to any length you need.</li>
  <li>Can easily be mounted. They can be surface mounted directly to the machine table.</li>
  <li>They are more durable.</li>
  <li>Thinnest scale to mount.</li>
</ul>

 <br />
<strong>100% Laser Calibration:</strong><br />
  Our magnetic scales are individually inspected and calibrated by Innovative\'s in-house laser interferrometer to ensure 100% accuracy, each magnetic scale comes with a calibration certificate.

<b>Are magnetic or glass scales the same ?<br />
</b><dl><dt>Many linear measurement systems are based on optical principles (glass scale). A 
          light source and photo-detector are guided along a glass scale to "read" 
          the overlapping patterns of light, which shine through or reflected 
          from the grating on the glass. This is a source of problems as this 
          optical method is prone to suffer in the machine tool environment. Any 
          machining process will cause a build-up of dirt, dust and grime carried 
          by the oil and coolants. This same build-up can coat the glass grating 
          and when this happens the measurement stops, production stops and with 
          it goes your profitability! <br />
</dt>
<dt>So please consider this simple point and remember that with glass 
          scales... if it does not see, it does not work! <strong style="font-style: italic;">Magnetic scales are immune to dirt build-up, dust and grime carried 
          by the oil and coolants.</strong><br />
