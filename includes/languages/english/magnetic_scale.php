<strong>Magnetic scales are :</strong><br />
<ul>
  <li>Immune to coolant and dust. They have full IP-67 rating ( scales 
suited for contaminated or dirty environmental conditions). <br />
</li>
<li>Very durable than the glass type.</li>
<li>Can easily cut it to desired length.</li>
<li>Easily be mounted. Our sales can be surface mounted directly to the table.other brands require!<br />
</li>
</ul>
 <br />
<strong>Lathe Kit scale resolution:</strong><br />

    Cross axis: 1 micron (0.00005") resolution IP-67 rated magnetic scale<br />
    Longitude axis: 5 micron (0.0002") resolution IP-67 rated magnetic scale<br />

<br />
<strong>Mill Kit scale resolution:</strong><br />

    All axis 5 micron (0.0002") resolution IP-67 rated magnetic scale<br />

<b>Are magnetic or glass scales the same ?<br />
</b><dl><dt>Many linear measurement systems are based on optical principles (glass scale). A 
          light source and photo-detector are guided along a glass scale to "read" 
          the overlapping patterns of light, which shine through or reflected 
          from the grating on the glass. This is a source of problems as this 
          optical method is prone to suffer in the machine tool environment. Any 
          machining process will cause a build-up of dirt, dust and grime carried 
          by the oil and coolants. This same build-up can coat the glass grating 
          and when this happens the measurement stops, production stops and with 
          it goes your profitability! <br />
</dt>
<dt>So please consider this simple point and remember that with glass 
          scales... if it does not see, it does not work! <strong style="font-style: italic;">Magnetic scales are immune to dirt build-up, dust and grime carried 
          by the oil and coolants.</strong><br />
