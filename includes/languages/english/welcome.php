define('TEXT_WELCOME_INFORMATION', '<p>Welcome to ACCUDRO Systems!!
<p>
We are glad to introduce the "Innovative Automations" line of Digital Readouts. Choose from 2 or 3 axis complete DRO kits with magnetic scales. 
<p>
Why Magnetic scales ? they are immune to coolant and dust and are very durable than the glass scales. Unlike glass scales they can be cut to any length you need. They are very thin and very easy to mount. 
<p>
Our magnetic scales are individually inspected and calibrated by Innovative\'s in-house laser interferrometer to ensure 100% accuracy, each magnetic scale comes with a calibration certificate.

<p>Digital readouts from ACCUDRO Systems will make your manually operated machine tools more profitable, improve productivity, and raise the quality of the machined workpiece. 
The large displays on DRO clearly shows the actual axis positions accurately. Bundled with the linear magnetic scales from ACCUDRO Systems they form an perfect economic/effective package solution for new initial setup or retrofitting on your existing machine tool.
